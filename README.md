Python code for creating several different patterns using nested loops and print statements. Each of the patterns is commented out, and there are instructions on how to use the code to print the pattern using a symbol of the user's choice. Patterns include a triangle, a reverse triangle, a diamond, a diamond with a triangle cut out, a pyramid, and a pyramid with a triangle cut out.
